## Assignment Aim 
ü•Ö The goal of this assignemnt is to create a Web App that will be useful to my team and workplace.

I work in the Household team in my workplace. I have decided to create a simple calcualtor which produces the likely loan-to-income or loan-to-value that somebody will be offrered on a mortgage, based on criteria about themselves that they input. 

The web app will interactive and give the user different options of what they want to produce.

I will create documentation and Read-Me files for different parts of the project, recording both how I create my project and how it will be maintained and managed in the future.

## Planning - Agile method

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄ This project will follow the Agile method, which is an iterative and flexible approach that allows for continuous improvement and adaptation to changing requirements.

While working on it I will break down the project into smaller chunks. I will monitor these using issues on the kanban board, which will allow me to monitor and plan tasks while still being able to easily adapt the plan as there are changes to requirements. Before I begin I will have a sprint planning meeting where the tasks are determined, each of which will have a clear goal which is easy to determine if it has been completed or not.  

As this is a small project it is not necessary to assign large periods of time for each chunk (for eaxmple in a larger project this may be two weeks), but I will have daily meetings with my team to discuss my progress and recieve any feedback which I can apply. The team will have access to my project and kanban board so they are able to see 

## LTI and LTV calaculator
üè† My idea for my app which I pitched to my team was to create a calculator which would be publicaly available on our workplace's website which people could use to understand the Loan-to-Value or Loan-to-Income they are likely to be offered when purchasing a property. My workplace has rules and guidance for Banks and mortgage providers, so this will be useful to help the public understand what rules are in place. 

My idea was to allow the user to have the option to enter their income and be told what what size loan they are likely to be offered (based on the curent average LTI), or enter the value of the house they would like to purchase and be told how much they would likely be offered for the loan. This is a helpful tool to be able to work out what size deposit they would need, or if they need to reconsider their budget for the property. 


## Figma Prototype
üé® I used the platform Figma to create a prototype that I wanted my calculator to look like.

![Image showing first figma prototype](/Images/Prototype_1.jpg "Prototype 1")
Firstly, I came up with a general idea of what I wanted my app to look like. I knew that I wanted to have the information at the top, with the interactive buttons and calculations at the bottom. This makes the most sense logically, and ensures the person has read everything they need to before beginning to use the program.

Next, I decided which buttons I would have, and where they would be placed on the app. In this prototype I highlight what each button is, such as an input button or just a text box.

Finally, I added the details to the prototype and produced the final design. I decided which image I would be using, and matched the colours of the other boxes to it to improve the look. I also added the text and description of what the product would be doing to produce the final workable prototype.

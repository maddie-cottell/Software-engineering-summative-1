## Assignment Aim 
ü•Ö The goal of this assignemnt is to create a Web App that will be useful to my team and workplace.

I work in the Household team in my workplace. I have decided to create a simple calcualtor which produces the likely loan-to-income or loan-to-value that somebody will be offrered on a mortgage, based on criteria about themselves that they input. 

The web app will interactive and give the user different options of what they want to produce.

I will create documentation and Read-Me files for different parts of the project, recording both how I create my project and how it will be maintained and managed in the future.

## Planning - Agile method

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄ This project will follow the Agile method, which is an iterative and flexible approach that allows for continuous improvement and adaptation to changing requirements.

While working on it I will break down the project into smaller chunks. I will monitor these using issues on the kanban board, which will allow me to monitor and plan tasks while still being able to easily adapt the plan as there are changes to requirements. Before I begin I will have a sprint planning meeting where the tasks are determined, each of which will have a clear goal which is easy to determine if it has been completed or not.  

As this is a small project it is not necessary to assign large periods of time for each chunk (for eaxmple in a larger project this may be two weeks), but I will have daily meetings with my team to discuss my progress and recieve any feedback which I can apply. The team will have access to my project and kanban board so they are able to see 

## LTI and LTV calaculator
üè† My idea for my app which I pitched to my team was to create a calculator which would be publicaly available on our workplace's website which people could use to understand the Loan-to-Value or Loan-to-Income they are likely to be offered when purchasing a property. My workplace has rules and guidance for Banks and mortgage providers, so this will be useful to help the public understand what rules are in place. 

My idea was to allow the user to have the option to enter their income and be told what what size loan they are likely to be offered (based on the curent average LTI), or enter the value of the house they would like to purchase and be told how much they would likely be offered for the loan. This is a helpful tool to be able to work out what size deposit they would need, or if they need to reconsider their budget for the property. 


## Figma Prototype
üé® I used the platform Figma to create a prototype that I wanted my calculator to look like.

Firstly, I came up with a general idea of what I wanted my app to look like. I knew that I wanted to have the information at the top, with the interactive buttons and calculations at the bottom. This makes the most sense logically, and ensures the person has read everything they need to before beginning to use the program.

Next, I decided which buttons I would have, and where they would be placed on the app. In this prototype I highlight what each button is, such as an input button or just a text box.

Finally, I added the details to the prototype and produced the final design. I decided which image I would be using, and matched the colours of the other boxes to it to improve the look. I also added the text and description of what the product would be doing to produce the final workable prototype.

## Usage 

üñ•Ô∏è Using this program is simple! All you need to do is clone the repository onto your local device on a platform which supports Git, such as Visual Studio Code. All of the files are stored within the same directory and automatically produce outputs which feed into one another, so it is possible to run the calculator and the testing straight away. 

It is likely that this program will require maintenace, such as updating the standard LTI and LTV as the market and trends change. This should be a small to fix to do, changing one number which is marked by a comment in the code.

It is important to run the testing after making any changes to ensure that the program is continuing to work as intended. 

## Evaluation

üèÅOverall, I enjoyed this assignment and thought it was successful. I was able to build a calculator using which will be beneficial for my workplace and is ready to be implemented.

Using Github enhanced the overall project by allowing me to work incrementally, and track what I had done. As I worked through the project it was very useful to be able to look at the commit history to keep track of what I had done, and by linking branches to issues in my kanban board it was very easy to stay on top of my to do list.

I did face some challenges when completing this assignment. When I began I initially had some trouble getting used to using Github and its different features. There were also some simple things that I just wasn't used to and I got stuck on, such as using a hyphon instead of a space when creating links in the contents bar, which required time and further research to overcome. 

I also had some trouble with the testing when I began because I had never used the JEST method before, but I was happy with the testing methods that I was able to create.

If I was to complete this project again or had the oppurtunity to expand on it in the future I would like to expand what my web page is able to do, such as allowing the user to enter the deposit that they are planning to put down, and other characteristics about themself that would affect the mortgage they would be offered.
